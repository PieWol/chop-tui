to quickly test this you need a valid proposal with a valid preimage.

1. select polkadot as relay
2. enter hash: 0x3e2c708625d90b20143760ff13d1f5bedd250e7482cb376f9a8d04a3eb73311f
3. enter len: 165

4. enjoy your chopsticks network

TODO: Sadly it doesn't work as expected yet. The call doesn't seem to be correctly executed even though I tried to push it into the scheduler pallet.
This would need to work to then display the changes that result from the chopsticks command. Also the chopsticks call doesn't exit after the script ends.
